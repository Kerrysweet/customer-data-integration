        "\n",
        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "A small-to-medium business (SMB) is currently facing challenges with fragmented customer data across multiple departments and systems. The company has experienced significant growth in customer numbers and seeks to unify customer records from disparate sources into a consolidated database to enable better data analysis and decision-making. This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive data pipeline that extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a unified format, and loads it into a central relational database.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Current Challenges\n",
        "1. **Data Fragmentation**: Customer data is scattered across multiple departments (Finance, HR, Marketing, etc.)\n",
        "2. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Data exists in multiple formats including CSV, JSON, XML, and TXT files\n",
        "3. **No Single Customer View**: Inability to create a comprehensive view of each customer\n",
        "4. **Manual Data Processing**: Current data integration requires manual intervention\n",
        "5. **Limited Analysis Capability**: Difficulty in performing cross-departmental data analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Goals\n",
        "1. Design and implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to consolidate customer data\n",
        "2. Create a unified customer data model in a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)\n",
        "3. Develop a systematic approach to match and merge customer records from different sources\n",
        "4. Implement data quality checks and validation mechanisms\n",
        "5. Enable basic analytics on the consolidated customer data\n",
        "6. Document the process and prepare for future scaling\n",
        "\n",
